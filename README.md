# Alcometer

This is a mobile application built using React Native that calculates a person's blood alcohol content (BAC) based on their weight, gender, number of drinks consumed, and time elapsed since consumption. The user inputs their weight, the number of 33 cl bottles of alcohol they consumed, the number of hours since their last drink, and their gender (male or female).

The app then calculates the grams of alcohol in the person's system based on the amount of alcohol they consumed and their weight, subtracts the grams burned off based on their weight and time elapsed, and calculates the person's BAC.

The app uses several third-party libraries, including Expo, React Native Paper, and React Native Numeric Input, and includes custom styling defined in a separate file.
